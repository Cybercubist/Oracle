# Oracle

**The task**: to create some toy platform, which draws "the charts of future". It should forecast prices movement of any asset.

**The solution:** We created some forecasting platform and for that purpose we used <ins>CandleHandle evalualtions</ins> again.

Oracle platform is analysing a chart in the past plus CH evaluation. Then it tries to predict future price movements in the next 50 days. Oracle's algorithm considers asset's volatility and adds some randomness there. It also may consider user's fair price evaluation for more accurate forecasts.

Oracle is <ins>not a finished product</ins>, rather it is some sample for future work. Forecasting algorithms here may be significantly improved later. Furthermore, Oracle may be a part of a more sophisticated analytical platform.

**Current version:** <ins>Oracle 1.0.0.</ins> Oracle has it's own version number since 27.11.2023.

**Updates:** coming soon...

**Disclaimer:** Oracle analysis is not a personal investment advice. You should manage your risks carefully, the author and developers are not responsible for your losses!
